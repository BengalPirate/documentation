# Welcome Skele-Friend! ðŸ’€âœ¨

This is the official and most up-to-date place to find documentation for FreeMoCap. We're slowly building a Knowledge Base that roughly follows the ['diataxis framework'](https://diataxis.fr/). Our documentation is very much a work in progress, so we appreciate your patience, support, and engagement!

If you're looking for a quick start, head on over to our ["How to" Guides](how_to_guides/index.md) page!

??? info "These docs are a work in progress! Better tutorials/walkthroughs/etc coming soon!"
    
    We are very close to out `v0.1.0` release, and there will be a new round of tutorials/walk-throughs/etc released around then.  

    In the mean time, check out [this (rough) video](https://youtu.be/GxKmyKdnTy0) which  provides a broad overview of some of the topics relevant to camera-based markerless motion capture ( *HINT - Look at the video chapters for specific topics.*)
