# Welcome ðŸ’€âœ¨

<del>Its 24 July 2022, and I'm just playing around with `mkdocs` right now. Seems pretty cool!</del>

Its 18 Aug 2022, and I put it up on `readthedocs` - Nothing useful in here yet, but like... JUST IMAGINE IF THERE WAS :O 

We're planning to build a Knowledge Base that roughly follows the ['diataxis framework'](https://diataxis.fr/)

...but until then, I'm just going to point you back to the (`README.md`) in the main repository:
[https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap](https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap)

We've also got a pretty nice website:
[https://freemocap.org](https://freemocap.org)

Work in progress, stay tuned!!
