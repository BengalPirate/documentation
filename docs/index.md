# Welcome ðŸ’€âœ¨


At the moment, the closest thing we have to proper docs is [this brain dumpy video](https://youtu.be/GxKmyKdnTy0) (check the chapters for specific topics)



We're planning to build a Knowledge Base that roughly follows the ['diataxis framework'](https://diataxis.fr/), but until then I'm just going to point you back to the (`README.md`) in the main repository:
[https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap](https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap)

We've also got a pretty nice website:
[https://freemocap.org](https://freemocap.org)

If you run into trouble, your best bet is to either:

- Post an Issue in the `freemocap` repository: [https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap/issues](https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap/issues)   

- Join the Discord and ask a question in the #help-requests channel: [Click here to join our Discord](https://discord.gg/P2nyraRYjb)


Work in progress, stay tuned!!
