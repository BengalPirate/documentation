# Introduction to FreeMoCap -  A Free Open Source Markerless Motion Capture System

## 1. Overview

FreeMoCap (free motion capture) is a [[free open source ]]markerless motion capture system designed to provide research-quality motion capture data using free software and generic, minimal-cost webcams. It is designed to be usable by people with no technical expertise while remaining a viable project for high-level scientific researchers. The data it provides can be useful for any project that involves human movement, including scientific research, 3D animation, sports biomechanics, and more.

## 2. Features and Capabilities

FreeMoCap features a complete GUI-based interface that can create high-quality kinematic data from single cameras, multiple cameras, or imported videos. It also produces data outputs in the form of numpy arrays, CSVs, a Blender output scene, and a preloaded Jupyter notebook that is set up for analyzing the data that was just produced. This is especially useful for classroom settings or immediate opportunities for exploratory data analysis the moment the data is done processing. The software is designed to work with minimal-cost, low-quality USB webcams, as well as asynchronous recording methods such as GoPros. Support for research-grade cameras like FLIR or IP cameras like White Matter is planned.

## 3. Community Involvement and Support

FreeMoCap has a vibrant and growing community of users and developers, including research and clinical scientists, 3D animators, video game designers, and open-source software developers. Most of the community is centered around a Discord server, which you can join [here](link_to_discord). Here, people can ask questions and receive support from the developers and other members of the community. Feature requests and bug reports should be submitted to the GitHub issues space.
