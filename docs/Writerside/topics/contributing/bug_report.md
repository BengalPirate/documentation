# Bug Reports

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a "great" bug report.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Include an uploaded ZIP of the freemocap data session you ran that produced the issue.
  - Give sample code if you can. [This stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) demonstrates the user giving as much information as possible.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. The likelihood that the community and/or maintainers will help you with your issues stems from how well you can help them understand you. :)
