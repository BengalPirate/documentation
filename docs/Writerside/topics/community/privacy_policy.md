# Privacy Policy

We respect and value your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect any personal or anonymous data we may collect from users of our software. By using our software, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. "We" refers to the FreeMoCap development team, which maintains the FreeMoCap software. "You" refers to the user of our software.

User data helps us understand how we can make our software better for you and allows us to demonstrate to agencies and corporations that people are using our software, which may help us to grow the project in the future.

## Collection of Anonymous User Data

If you check the "Send anonymous usage information" check box on the main page of the GUI, we will collect anonymous user data when you use our software. This information is sent to us as a "ping" of data [posted](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/#post-a-multipart-encoded-file) to [pipedream](https://pipedream.com/) every time the software is used. 

The data we currently collect includes:

- your IP Address (because the "ping" is sent to pipedream via a POST request, we cannot avoid collecting your IP address)
- The time the "ping" was sent 
- information about your cameras

You can view the code that collects this data [here](https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap/blob/main/freemocap/system/user_data/pipedream_pings.py).

If you do not wish to share your data, you may turn off "pings" at any point in time. To turn off user pings, uncheck the "Send anonymous usage information" box on the home screen of the FreeMoCap GUI.

## Protection of User Data

We take the protection of your data seriously and will not sell or distribute any personal or anonymous data we collect to third parties, except as required by law. We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Currently, only core FreeMoCap developers (Jonathan Matthis, and Trenton Wirth) have access to the user data we have collected.

## Your Control Over Your Data

As a user of our software, you have control over your data. You can choose to turn off "pings" at any point in time by unchecking the "Send anonymous usage information" box on the home screen of the FreeMoCap GUI.

If you wish to have your user data deleted, you may contact us at info AT freemocap DOT org.

## Updates to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy as our project evolves, so please check back periodically for changes. Your continued use of our software after any changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our use of your data, please contact us at info AT freemocap DOT org, or reach out to us on our Discord.
