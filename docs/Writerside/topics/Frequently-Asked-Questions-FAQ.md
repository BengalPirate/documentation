## Does FreeMoCap work in realtime?

No, FreeMoCap does not currently work in realtime. It's a goal of ours, and we're currently restructuring our software to make this possible, but it will take some time.

## Can FreeMoCap track multiple people at once?

No, FreeMoCap only tracks one person at a time. We're working towards this functionality, but keeping track of which person is which across multiple camera views is hard.

## Can I track things that are not humans?

No, FreeMoCap currently only tracks humans. We're working towards implementing DeepLabCut based animal tracking soon, and object tracking will follow that, but for now it's just humans.
