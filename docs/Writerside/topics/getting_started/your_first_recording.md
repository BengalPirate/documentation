# Your First Recording


> **Do the easy one first!**
> 
> We recommend that everybody starts with a single-camera reconstruction even if you intend to make multi-camera later.
> 
> Single-camera recordings are MUCH simpler and faster than multi-camera recordings, and will help ensure that the full pipeline works on your computer with your hardware.
> 
> Once that is established, you'll have a great baseline understanding of the complete process before moving to the more complex task of creating a multi-camera calibration and recording.
