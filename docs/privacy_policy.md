# Privacy Policy

We respect and value your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect any personal or anonymous data we may collect from users of our software. By using our software, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## Collection of Anonymous User Data

We may collect anonymous user data when you use our software. This information includes a "user ping" of data [posted](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/#post-a-multipart-encoded-file) to [pipedream](https://pipedream.com/) every time the software is used. This data helps us understand how we can make our software better users. We may also use this information to demonstrate to agencies and corporations that people are using our software, which may help us to grow the project.

The data we currently collect includes:
- your IP Address
- The time the "user ping" was sent 
- information about the hardware of the cameras
- information about the 3D positioning of the cameras 

This list may change over time, but we will always keep it up to date. If you wish to [inspect the code yourself](https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap), you are welcome to, as the software is and always will be free and open source. Alternatively, if you do not wish to share your data, you may turn off "user pings" at any point in time. To turn off user pings, uncheck the "Send User Pings" box on the home screen of the FreeMoCap GUI.

## Protection of User Data

We take the protection of your data seriously and will not sell or distribute any personal or anonymous data we collect to third parties, except as required by law. We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Currently, only core FreeMoCap developers (Jonathan Matthis, and Trenton Wirth) have access to the user data we have collected.

## Your Control Over Your Data

As a user of our software, you have control over your data. You can choose to turn off "user pings" at any point in time by unchecking the "Send User Pings" box on the home screen of the FreeMoCap GUI.

## Updates to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please check back periodically for changes. Your continued use of our software after any changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes.

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our use of your data, please contact us at info AT freemocap DOT org, or reach out to us on our Discord.
