# Contributing to the FreeMoCap Project


Welcome to the FreeMoCap contributing guide! 

This document will help you understand how to contribute to the project, whether you're reporting bugs, suggesting new features, or submitting code changes. We're excited to have you on board and look forward to working with you!

## Getting Started

## Installing FreeMoCap from source code


## Reporting Bugs 

Your feedback is invaluable in improving FreeMoCap. In this section, you'll learn how to report bugs and suggest new features for the project.

## Suggesting Features

We welcome your ideas for new features or improvements to FreeMoCap. To suggest a feature, [open a new issue](https://github.com/freemocap/freemocap/issues/new) and describe the feature, its benefits, and any potential challenges in implementing it.

For details, see our [Feature Request](./feature_request.md)  guide

## Code Contributions

Contributing code to FreeMoCap involves creating and submitting pull requests. In this section, you'll learn about our development process, coding styles, and testing requirements.

### We Use GitHub Flow

We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) as our development process. It makes it easy for contributors to submit changes and maintainers to review and merge them.

  
###  Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests  
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). 

We actively welcome your pull requests:  
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.  
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.  
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.  
4. Ensure the test suite passes.  
5. Make sure your code lints.  
6. Issue that pull request!

### Coding Styles

Consistent coding styles are important for maintaining a clean and easy-to-understand codebase. We use the following style guides for our project:


- [Python Code Style Guide](./python_code_style_guide.md)
- PyQT: [COMING SOON]
- API: [COMING SOON]


### Testing

We require tests for all code contributions to ensure the stability and reliability of the project. When submitting a pull request, make sure your code is covered by tests, and that those tests pass our Github Actions workflow.

Here's a nice introduction to [testing in Python](https://realpython.com/python-testing/).
