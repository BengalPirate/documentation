    We recommend that everybody starts with a single-camera reconstruction even if you intend to make multi-camera later.
    
    Single-camera recordings are MUCH simpler and faster than multi-camera recorings, and will help ensure that the full pipeline works on your computer with your hardware. 

    Once that is established, you'll have a great baseline understanding of the compete process before moving to the more complex task of creating a multi-camera calibration and recording
